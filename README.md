# mod_background

A Joomla! module that loads images from a specified directory and loads them into [Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/ "Backstretch")

I'm not actively developing any of my Joomla! modules, just tidying them up and putting them on github.

TODO:
- put JS into a closure.
